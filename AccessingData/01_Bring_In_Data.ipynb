    "The first type ***File*** variables are just a piinter (or handle) to a variable in a file. It is very useful to query the variable as shown in the previous notebook. The actual data is still on disk and is not loaded into memory yet. Once you get more experienced with CDAT/cdms2 this has usefull implication for things like distributed computing (dask, mpi, etc...).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second type is the ***Transient Variable*** these variables possess the same query function as *File Variables* but their data is now in memory rather than in their original file. \n",
    "\n",
    "***WARNING***: ANY operation on a file variable will convert it to a ***Transient Variable*** keep this in mind as it has memory implication (e.g you do not want to load a 3Tb variable in memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "cdms variables can be treated just like a *supercharged* `numpy` array. As the figure bellow demonstrates they are a numpy array PLUS a mask marking area where values are to be ignored (missing or bad) PLUS dimensions information (axes) to describe the array PLUS metadata about the array itself and its dimensions.\n",
