    "# Regridding in CDAT\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever you're dealing with CMIP data you will likely encounter the issue of \"regridding\", i.e going from one model's grid to another\n",
    "\n",
    "CDAT comes with 3 different regridders: *regrid2*, *esmf* and *libcf*\n",
    "\n",
    "## regrid2\n",
    "\n",
    "Regrid2 is CDAT's original regridder, it an area-based regridder that works only on rectilinear grids, for more info see [this PCMDI report](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/report/pdf/34.pdf?id=76)\n",
    "\n",
    "## scripp\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripp regridder is possible provided that you have the scripp weight file.\n",
    "\n",
    "## libcf\n",
    "\n",
    "libcf is the second regridder ported to CDAT, it is not maintained anymore as in no new feature will be added. It was developped by unicar, for more info see [this page](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/libcf/html/group__gs__regrid__grp.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "## esmf\n",
    "\n",
    "ESMF regridder is currently CDAT's default regridder. It was integrated with CDAT to enable easy use of this powerful tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Default regridder\n",
    "\n",
    "Regridding in CDAT is done via the `cdms2` module, the default regridder *tool* is `esmf`, the default regrid *method* is `linear`\n",
